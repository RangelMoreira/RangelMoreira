## Hey there, I'm Kevin  👋

I am a junior JavaScript /Typescript developer and a Java Spring Boot student who believes in using technology to make people's lives a little easier.

I am currently focused on React Js/React Native, Node js and Java Spring Boot technologies to create the best solutions. 

In addition I am enthusiastic about IOT and handmade hardware, and I like to create projects with Arduino in my free time.
